	In order to facilitate a simple, heterogenous frame for every page, I will use a single php import to import a 
series of functions which will then be used ot import the proper html

	The advantags to this approach are:
		1. simple, concise calls to get info...

			getHeadStart(),getMetaData(), getHeader() etc.

		2. The ability to dynamically change output
			getMeta(title) will be able to set the title of the page on the back end, for SEO.
		
		3. And the regular benefits of using a single framework for everypage.

So, in every page, import "src/php/frame.php".
